# JS Questions!

I made a quick Deno scraper to grab questions from [this repo](https://github.com/sudheerj/javascript-interview-questions)

To get it up and running:
Firstly, you'll need Deno installed

```bash
brew install deno
```

Then just run the script:

```bash
deno run --unstable --allow-all scraper.ts
```
